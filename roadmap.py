US: https://bit.ly/4bI9Yix CA: https://bit.ly/3I6v3Wv Learn about the foundations of machine learning (ML) in this video, and how machine learning is different from artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. We will discuss the 3 types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Then, we'll learn about the different types of supervised learning tasks/outputs: classification, and regression, and how they are different.
